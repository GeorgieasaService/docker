# Docker 

I started my docker training and wanted to document some commands that are good to know and use.

## Docker commands

install docker on ubuntu with this command:

Enabling and starting docker service automatically
```
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker
```

Add your user to the docker group to avoid using sudo all the time
```
sudo usermod -aG docker username
```
